## Dictation

Puma are large cat-like animals which are found in America. When report came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spot at forty-five miles south of London. They were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate. Experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate. For the description given by people who claim to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw a large cat, only five yard away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it. An expert confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma often observed one place in the morning, and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went it left behind dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found cling to bushes. Several people complainted of cat-like noise at night, and business man on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from. As no puma has been reported missing from any zoo in the country. This one must have been a in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escaped. The hunt went on for several weeks but the puma was not caught. It's disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.
