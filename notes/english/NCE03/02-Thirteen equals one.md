# 02-Thirteen equals one

## Dictation

Our vicar has always raising money for one cause or another, but he had never managed to have enough money to have the church clock repired. The big clock which strike day and night, was danmaged many years ago, and has been silence ever since.

One night our vicar woke up with a start, the clock was striking the hour. Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock, but the bell stroke thirteen times before it stoped. Armed with a torch, the vicar when up to the clock tower to see what's going on. In the torch light, he caught a sight of figuire who he immediately recognized that bill willgen our local grosser.

"Whatever are doing bill?" asked the vicar and surprise.

"I am trying to repire the bell." answered bill. "I've been coming here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give a surprise."

"You certainly did give me a surprise." said vicar. "You probbly woken up everyone at the village as well, still I am gald the bell is working again."

"That's the trouble vicar." answered bill. "It's working alright, but I am afraid that one o'clock it will strike thirteen times, and there is nothing I can do about it."

"We'll get used to that bill." said vicar. "Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing. Now let's go down stairs, and have a cup of tea."
