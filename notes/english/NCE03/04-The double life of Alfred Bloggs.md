# 04-The double life of Alfred Bloggs

## Preface

This is a story about manual job and white-collar job. The salary of manual job is higher, but most people choose the white-collar job, for it can provide a better social statue.

## Dictation

These days, people doing manual work often receive far more money than people who work in offices. People work in office are frequentlly refer to as white-collar workers, for the simple reason they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifse higher pay for the privallege of becoming white-collar workers. This can give rise to curisous situation, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who work as dust man for the alss cooperation.

When he got married, Alfred is too emberssed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he work for the cooperation. Every morning he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overall and spend the next 8 hours as a dust man. Before returning home at night, he took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alfred did this for over two years, and his fellow dust man kept he secret. Alfred's wife had never found that she was married a dust man, and she never will, for Alfred has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he felt that his rise in status is well worth the lost of the money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day, and others will call him Mr Bloggs not Alfred.
