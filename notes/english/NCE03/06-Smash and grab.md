## Dictation

The expensive shops in the famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening. At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jeary shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his asistants had been working busily since 8 o'clock and had only just finished. Diamons neckless and rings had been beautifully arranged on the background of black vecllet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.

The silence was suddenly broken when a large car with it's headlights on and it's horn glaring down the arcade. It came to start outside the jealors. One man stayed at the wheel, while two other with black stockings over their faces, jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bar. While this was going on, Mr. taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thief was stroke by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamens to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for men scrambled back into the car and moved off at a fatastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. taylor rushed out and went after it, throwing ashtray and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamons.
