# 08-A famous monastery

## Dictation

The Great St. Bernard Pass connects switzerland to Italy. At 2,473 meters, it's the highest mountain pass in Europe. The famous monastery of St. Bernard which was found in the 11 century lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years,St. Bernard's dogs had saved the lives of travelers crossing the dangerous pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times. Now that the tunnel has been built through the mountain, the pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow, when ever a traveler is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people, who rashly attempt to cross the pass on foot.

During the summer month, the monastery is very busy, for it's visited by thousands of people who cross the pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, however, life in monastery is quite different. The tempareture drops to -30 degrees, and very few people attempt to cross the pass. The monastery prefer winter to summer, for they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom too, for they are allow to wonder outside their enclosure. The only regular visiters to the monastery in winter, are parties of skiers, who go there at Chrismas and Easter. These young people who love the peace of the mountain, always receive a warm welcome at St. monastery.
