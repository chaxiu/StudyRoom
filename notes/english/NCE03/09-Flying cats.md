# Flying cats

## Dictation

Cats never failed to facinate human beings. They can be friendly and affection towards hunmans, but they live mesterious lives of their own as well. They never become submisive like dogs or horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect finline independence. Most cats remain sespicious of humans all their lives. One of the things that facinate us most about cats, is the popular belifes that they have nine lives. Aprarently, there is a good deal of truth in this idea. A cat's ability to suvive falls is based on fact.

Recently, the New York animal medical center made a study of 132 cats over up a period of five months. All the cats have one experience in common, they have fallen off high buildings, yet only 8 of them die from shock or injury. Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an intresting study, because there is no shortage of tall buildings. There are plenty of high-rise window cells to fall from. One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 storaies, yet only suffered from a broken tooth. Cats behave like well trained paratroopers, a docter said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injury themselves. In a long drop, they reach speed of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cat have time to relax. They strenth out their leggs, like flying squross. This increases of  their air resistences, and reduce the shock of the impact, when they hit the ground.
