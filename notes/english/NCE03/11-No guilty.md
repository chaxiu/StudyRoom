## No guilty

## Dictation

Customs officers are quite tolorent these days, but they still stop you while you going through the green channel and have nothing to declare. Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The harden prefessional smaggler on the other hand, is never troubled by these feelings, even he has 500 golden watches hidden in his suitcase. When I return from abroad, a perticullarly official young customs officer clearly regarded me as a smaggler. 
"Have you anything to declare?" He asked, looked me in the eye.
"No." I answered confidently.
"Would you mind unlocking this suitcase please?"
"No at all." I answered.
The officer went through the case with great care. All the things I have packed so carefully was soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the officer's face lighted up. He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case, and he pounced on it with delight.
"Perfume, ahe." He asked, sacasiticly.
"You should have declared that, perfume is not exampt import duty."
"But, it isn't perfume." I said, "It's hair jul."
Then I added with a smile, "It's a strange mixture I made myself."
As I expected, he did not belived me.
"Try it." I said encoragingly.
The officer unscrewed the capain put the bottle to his nostrils. He was read by an unplesant smell, which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk mark on my package.
