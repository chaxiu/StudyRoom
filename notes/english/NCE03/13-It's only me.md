## It's only me

## Dictation

After her husband had gone to work. Mrs Richard sent her children to school and went upstairs to her bedroom. She was too excited to do any housework that morning, for in the evening, she would be going to a fancy-dress party with her husband. She intended to dress up as a ghost, and as she had made her costume the night before, she wasn't patient to try it on. Thought the costume consisted only of sheet, it was very effective. After puting it on, Mrs Richard went downstairs. She wanted to find out weather it would be comfortable to wear.

Just as Mrs Richard was entering the dinning room, there was a knock on the front door. She knew that it must be the baker. She had told him to come straight in if he ever fail to open the door, and to leave the bread on the kitchen table. Not wanting to frighten the poor man, Mrs Richards quickly hid in the small store room under the stairs. She heard the front door opened and heavy footstep in the hall. Suddenly the door of the store room was opened, and a man entered. Mrs Richards realize that it must be the man from the Electricity Board who had come to read the metre. She tried to explain the situation saying: "It's only me." But it was too late. The man let out a cry and jumped back several passes. When Mrs Richard walked toward to him, he flated slamming the door behind him.
